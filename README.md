# GYM-Management
A complete web application developed in Eclipse IDE to streamline all gym operations.  This system effectively manages memberships, billing, and scheduling. It's built on a robust Java EE stack: JSP (UI), Java Servlets (Logic), JDBC (Database Link), and SQL (Data Storage). A perfect project demonstrating full-stack development and MVC principles.
